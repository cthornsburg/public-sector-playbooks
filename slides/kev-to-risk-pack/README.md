# KEV-to-Risk Pack (Cities/Counties) — Monthly Patch Governance

**Purpose:** translate CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) into an executive-friendly risk conversation and an IT-friendly remediation plan.

**What you get:**
- 5-slide exec deck (Markdown outline)
- 1-page IT action sheet template
- Simple patch SLA table (7/14/30)

**Cadence (recommended):** monthly, with an out-of-band addendum when CISA adds a KEV that touches internet-facing infrastructure.

## How to use
1) Pull the current KEV list (or deltas since last month).
2) Map KEVs to your environment (asset classes, internet-facing, privileged apps).
3) Present the exec deck (slides) to leadership.
4) Track remediation on the IT action sheet.
5) Repeat monthly.
