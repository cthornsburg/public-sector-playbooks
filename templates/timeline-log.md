# Incident Timeline Log (Template)

Purpose: build a defensible, shareable chronology. Keep it simple and consistent.

## Conventions
- Use **CT** unless otherwise noted.
- One event per row.
- Attach evidence references (ticket IDs, log export filenames, screenshot names).

## Timeline
| Time (CT) | Source (who/what) | Event / observation | Affected system/user | Evidence reference | Owner | Confidence (L/M/H) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Key pivots (optional)
- **Initial access likely:**
- **Privilege escalation likely:**
- **Lateral movement likely:**
- **Data access/exfiltration likely:**
- **Encryption impact (if ransomware):**
