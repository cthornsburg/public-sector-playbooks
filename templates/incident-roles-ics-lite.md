# Incident Roles (ICS-lite) — Public Sector (Template)

Use this to reduce chaos. One person can hold multiple roles in a small org, but **assign ownership**.

## Core roles
- **Incident Commander (IC):** overall decision-maker; sets priorities; approves major actions.
- **Operations / IT Lead:** executes containment/recovery tasks; coordinates sysadmins/MSP.
- **DFIR Lead (internal or external):** evidence preservation, triage guidance, forensic strategy.
- **Communications Lead:** internal comms + public statements; coordinates with leadership/PIO.
- **Liaison (Vendors/Partners):** ISP/MSP/cloud/insurance/legal; keeps contact log.
- **Scribe:** maintains incident log + timeline; tracks decisions + action items.
