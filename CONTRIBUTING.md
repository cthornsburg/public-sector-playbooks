# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve **Public Sector Playbooks**.

## Principles
- Keep content practical, reproducible, and written for public-sector realities.
- Prefer primary sources (CISA, NIST, FBI/DOJ) and include citations where possible.
- This repo is public: do not add sensitive data.

## What to contribute
- Improvements to existing playbooks (clarity, steps, checklists)
- New templates (intake forms, logs, decision trees, communications)
- Diagrams (Mermaid/Graphviz) with exported PNG/SVG
- Executive-friendly hosted pages under `/docs`

## Safety rules
- No credentials, private IPs, internal architecture diagrams, or sensitive incident details.
- Don’t paste real case data into tools.
- If you find sensitive data, follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Workflow
1) Fork the repo
2) Create a branch
3) Make changes
4) Open a PR describing:
   - What changed
   - Why it helps
   - Any references/citations

## Style
- Write for practitioners: short sections, clear headings, checklists.
- Avoid marketing language.
