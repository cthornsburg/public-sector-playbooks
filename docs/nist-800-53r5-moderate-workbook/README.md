# NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (Moderate) Workbook (Unofficial)

This is a **community, unofficial** self-assessment workbook based on a **Moderate-oriented subset** of **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**.

## Important notes

- **Guide, not policy.** This is a readiness/assessment guide for city/county leaders and administrators. It is **not** a complete control catalog implementation.
- **Not a full catalog.** 800-53 contains hundreds of controls. This workbook focuses on a practical “Moderate” slice commonly expected in real environments.
- **No sensitive data.** Do not paste secrets or regulated/sensitive data into this tool.
- **Local-only storage.** “Save Session” uses `localStorage` and is **not encrypted**.
